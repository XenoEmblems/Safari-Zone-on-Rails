  <h3>Rules:</h3>
  <p>When traversing through the Safari Zone a random Pokemon should appear.</p>
  <p>You must try to catch with a Safari Ball or try to lure/weaken it with bait and rocks.</p>
  <p>Running away will have you run from the current Pokemon and another one will take its place.</p>

  <h4>Alpha Notes:</h4>
  <p> Editing your Trainer Profile automatically refills your Safari Ball Count to 100.</p>
  <p> Only one of each Pokemon can be caught. You will have to give multiples bak to the Safari Zone.</p>
  <p>Rocks and Bait doesn't work in this build</p>
