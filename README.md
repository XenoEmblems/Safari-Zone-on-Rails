# Safari-Zone-on-Rails

Safari Zone (Still in Development)


Eric Doyle WDI Final Project May 15th, 2015

#Overview
This Ruby on Rails App was made to apply the skills that I have learned throughout the entirety of WDI with my love of Pokemon. Safari Zone was supposed to recreate the area of the same name from Pokemon Red/Blue where you wander around and try to catch Pokemon without using your own Pokemon but instead relying on Safari Balls, Rocks, and Bait. 

This App was made with Ruby on Rails using a Postgres Database with use of jQuery to provide click events to try to recreate the feel of the game. 


#Demo

Actions affecting and involving the catch rate of the pokemon are not put into effect as of this point but are going to be added in the future.
